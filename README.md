# Stroke-Prediction
The project aims to use machine learning for predicting stroke in individuals using their health indicators like presence of hypertension, heart disease, smoking status and other relevant information like age and gender. Apart from the standard cleaning and preprocessing steps, SMOTE Technique has been used to deal with the imbalanced nature of the dataset. The metrics for model evaluation have also been chosen keeping in mind the imbalanced data.
